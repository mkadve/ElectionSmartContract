# Voting System Smart Contract

## Overview

This Solidity smart contract implements a decentralized voting system on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows for the registration of candidates, voters, and facilitates the election process with features like casting votes and delegating voting rights.

## Contract Details

- **Admin:** The contract creator serves as the admin, enabling key administrative functions.
- **Election States:** The contract has three states - NOT_STARTED, ONGOING, and ENDED.
- **Candidates:** Candidates can be registered with their name and proposal.
- **Voters:** Voters can be registered with a unique name and address. Once registered, they can cast votes or delegate their voting rights.

## Contract Functions

1. **addCandidate:** Admin can add candidates before the election starts.
2. **addVoter:** Admin can register voters with unique names and addresses before the election starts.
3. **startElection:** Admin initiates the election process.
4. **castVote:** Voters can cast their votes for a specific candidate during the ongoing election.
5. **delegateVote:** Voters can delegate their voting rights to another address during the ongoing election.
6. **endElection:** Admin concludes the election, calculates winners, and transitions the state to ENDED.
7. **getCandidateDetails:** View details of a specific candidate.
8. **getWinnerDetails:** View details of the winning candidate(s) after the election ends.
9. **getVoterDetails:** View details of a specific voter.
10. **viewVoterProfile:** View the profile of a voter based on their address.

## Events

- **ElectionStarted:** Triggered when the admin starts the election.
- **ElectionEnded:** Triggered when the admin ends the election.
- **VoteCasted:** Triggered when a voter casts a vote.
- **VoteDelegated:** Triggered when a voter delegates their voting rights.
- **CandidateAdded:** Triggered when a new candidate is added.
- **NewVoterAdded:** Triggered when a new voter is registered.

## How to Use

1. Deploy the contract to the Ethereum blockchain.
2. Interact with the contract functions using an Ethereum wallet or DApp.

## Disclaimer

This smart contract is a simple implementation for educational purposes and may require additional features and security measures for production use.
